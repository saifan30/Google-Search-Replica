# Google Search Replica

## Overview

This project is a simple replica of Google's search interface, created as part of the CS50W Week 0 assignment. The website consists of three pages:

1. **Google Search** (`index.html`): The main search page with options to perform a standard Google search, access image search, or use advanced search.
2. **Google Image Search** (`images.html`): A page dedicated to searching for images using Google.
3. **Google Advanced Search** (`advanced.html`): A page that provides additional options to refine your search query, similar to Google's own advanced search page.

## Features

  - A centered search bar with rounded edges.
  - Two buttons: "Google Search" and "I'm Feeling Lucky".
  - Links in the upper-right corner to access Image Search and Advanced Search pages.
